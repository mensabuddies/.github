# Mensa App Würzburg

Some time ago, we came up with the idea that a homescreen widget for the canteen we usually go to while on University-Campus, that displays todays meals would be cool. The initial idea evolved into a bigger concept for a whole app, that can show you information about the cafeterias and canteens of the Studentenwerk Würzburg. Currently, the project is **still under development and not live yet**.

> **!  Important Note:** This is no official application of the Studentenwerk Würzburg! We are just two computer-science students doing this for fun. :D


## Setup
We are currently redesigning our infrastructure for an easier developer experience and better maintainability. More details will follow.
