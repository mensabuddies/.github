# Mensabuddies

Some time ago, we came up with the idea of creating a homescreen widget for the canteen we usually visit on campus, which would display the day’s meals. What started as a simple idea quickly grew into a broader concept: a complete app that provides information about all cafeterias and canteens. Currently, we only support the facilities of the Studierendenwerk Würzburg, but feel free to create a pull request and add other locations!

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
